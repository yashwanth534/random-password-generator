# Password Generator

This is a Python-based strong password generator that generates a password with a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. The password length is determined by user input, ensuring a minimum of 8 characters for security.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
Input the number of characters you want in your password (minimum 8 characters).
The script will output a randomly generated strong password.
Code Explanation
The script imports necessary modules (string, random) for generating a random password.
User input is taken for the number of characters, which must be at least 8.
The password is composed of:
60% letters (30% lowercase, 30% uppercase)
40% digits and special characters (20% digits, 20% punctuation)
The characters are randomly shuffled to enhance security.
